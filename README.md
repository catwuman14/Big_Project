# Meat Consumption Analysis & Prediction**

## ðŸ’¡ Real-World Application
Government & Policy Makers: Design sustainable food policies and tax regulations.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
Meat production is unsustainable due to its significant environmental impact, including high greenhouse gas emissions, excessive land use, and water consumption. Given its unsustainable practices, it is crucial to explore alternative food sources, such as plant-based options, and create policies that promote sustainable, eco-friendly diets to reduce the environmental burden and improve global food security.

This project aims to analyze and predict global meat consumption trends using machine learning. By leveraging economic, demographic, and environmental data, we can forecast meat demand and its implications for businesses, policymakers, and sustainability efforts.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

1. Analyze historical meat consumption data by country.

2. Identify key factors influencing meat consumption.

3. Develop predictive models for future meat consumption trends.

4. Provide actionable insights for businesses, policymakers, and researchers.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset & Data Sources

Data will come from 3 main sources:
1. Our World Data
2. OECD
3. Food and Agriculture
   
Following variables will be included:

*Meat_Consumption (kg per capita)
*Meat_Production_Tonnes
*GDP_per_capita (USD)
*Meat_Price_Index
*Total country population
*Urbanization_Rate (%)
*Vegetarian_Vegan_Population (%)
*Meat_Imports_Tonnes
*Meat_Exports_Tonnes
*Greenhouse gas emissions from meat production
*Water_Usage_Litres_per_Kg
*Meat_Tax_Policy

## ðŸ“Š Methodology

1. Data Collection & Cleaning â€“ Gather data from sources, clean missing values, and preprocess for analysis.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) â€“ Visualize trends and correlations between variables.
3. Feature Engineering â€“ Select key predictors for model training.
4. Machine Learning Models:
    Time Series Forecasting: ARIMA, Prophet, LSTM for future trend prediction.
    Regression Models: Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost for understanding relationships.
7. Model Evaluation & Optimization â€“ Tune hyperparameters and validate results.
8. Visualization & Dashboarding â€“ Present insights using interactive dashboards.
